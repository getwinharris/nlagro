NNL: The Organic Way To Yield

B2B Ecosystem & Global Trade Strategy (2026)

1. Unified User Architecture

NNL uses a Unified Account System. A single login allows any participant (Farmer, Wholesaler, or Public Investor) to act as a Referral Partner simultaneously.

Hybrid User Roles:

The Farmer (Collaborator/Producer):

Acts as the primary source of organic yield.
Dual Role: Can refer other farmers or investors to earn recurring commissions.

The Enterprise Buyer (Wholesaler):

Purchases on a Contract Bulk Basis (White Label/Private Label).
Dual Role: Can refer other global corporations or investors.

The Venture Investor:

Provides high-frequency liquidity to the ecosystem.
Dual Role: Can act as a lead agent, referring new capital to the Sprout-Growth Bond program.

2. Unified Referral & Commission System (Non-MLM)

The NNL referral model is a Direct Performance-Based Program. Commissions are only triggered upon verified KYC approval and successful capital investment.

Investment Referral Payout Structure (The 10+2 Model):

For every successful referral, the referrer earns in two stages (based on the investment amount):

Upfront Milestone Commission (10%): Paid instantly once the referred user’s Investment is confirmed and KYC (Aadhar/PAN) is approved.
Recurring Monthly Commission (2%): Paid for 5 consecutive months (matching the profit-sharing cycle of the investor).

| Plan Amount | Upfront (10%) | Monthly (2% x 5) | Total Referral Earn |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ₹10,000 | ₹1,000 | ₹200 / month | ₹2,000 |
| ₹25,000 | ₹2,500 | ₹500 / month | ₹5,000 |
| ₹50,000 | ₹5,000 | ₹1,000 / month | ₹10,000 |
| ₹1,00,000 | ₹10,000 | ₹2,000 / month | ₹20,000 |

3. The Investment Plan: Sprout-Growth Bond Tiers

The capital is deployed into high-velocity organic crops (Sprouts & Spinach) with 7-15 day cycles. All plans follow the 20% monthly return logic.

| Plan Tier | Monthly Payout (Months 1-5) | Month 6 Payout | Total Returns |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Seed (₹10k) | ₹2,000 | ₹10,000 (Capital) | ₹20,000 |
| Sapling (₹25k) | ₹5,000 | ₹25,000 (Capital) | ₹50,000 |
| Plant (₹50k) | ₹10,000 | ₹50,000 (Capital) | ₹1,00,000 |
| Tree (₹1L) | ₹20,000 | ₹1,00,000 (Capital) | ₹2,00,000 |
