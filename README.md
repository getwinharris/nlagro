# NNL: The Organic Way To Yield

## B2B Ecosystem & Global Trade Strategy (2026)

### 1. Unified User Architecture

NNL uses a Unified Account System. A single login allows any participant (Farmer, Wholesaler, or Public Investor) to act as a Referral Partner simultaneously.

**Hybrid User Roles:**

*   **The Farmer (Collaborator/Producer):** Acts as the primary source of organic yield. Can refer other farmers or investors to earn recurring commissions.
*   **The Enterprise Buyer (Wholesaler):** Purchases on a Contract Bulk Basis (White Label/Private Label). Can refer other global corporations or investors.
*   **The Venture Investor:** Provides high-frequency liquidity to the ecosystem. Can act as a lead agent, referring new capital to the Sprout-Growth Bond program.

### 2. Unified Referral & Commission System (Non-MLM)

The NNL referral model is a Direct Performance-Based Program. Commissions are only triggered upon verified KYC approval and successful capital investment.

**Investment Referral Payout Structure (The 10+2 Model):**

For every successful referral into the Sprout-Growth Bond (₹10k Plan), the referrer earns in two stages:

*   **Upfront Milestone Commission (10%):** ₹1,000 (per ₹10k unit). Paid instantly once the referred user’s Investment is confirmed and KYC (Aadhar/PAN) is approved.
*   **Recurring Monthly Commission (2%):** ₹200 per month. Paid for 5 consecutive months (matching the profit-sharing cycle of the investor).

**Total Referral Yield:** ₹2,000 per referred unit (20% total commission over 6 months).

### 3. Service Tiers: Branding & Packaging

*   **NNL Global Brand:** Premium "Sustainable Clarity" packaging.
*   **White Label:** Generic high-quality organic packaging for third-party branding.
*   **Private Label:** NNL prints and applies custom branding (Wholesale Contract Basis) at the Farmer/Hub level before export.

### 4. B2B Trade Flow (The "Hub" Model)

1.  **Contract Negotiation:** Wholesaler requests a quote (RFQ) for bulk volume.
2.  **Farmer Activation:** NNL assigns the contract to certified Farmers.
3.  **Source Packaging:** Farmer receives custom or NNL-branded materials.
4.  **DHL Global Export:** Integrated API triggers pickup and flight shipping directly to the global destination (Supermarkets/Corporations).
